.SH NAME
lswt - list Wayland toplevels

.SH SYNOPSIS
lswt [options...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
lswt will list all toplevels advertised by a Wayland server using the
foreign-toplevel-management-unstable-v1 protocol extension.
.P
By default lswt tries to format the data to be human readable. If you want to
parse the output, consider using one of the available machine readable output
modes.

<counter>: <state> <title> <app-id>

.P
The counter indicates in what order the toplevels have been advertised by the
server. It is also helpful to identify the same toplevel on multiple outputs.
.P
The state is a four wide field, corresponding to the four possible toplevel
states: maximized, minimized, activated and fullscreen. If one of these states
is true for a toplevel, their respective character in the field is set to the
first letter of the state name, otherwise it is -.
.P
The server must implement the xdg-output-unstable-v1 protocol extension for
lswt to fetch the output names. If the extension is not supported, the global
name of the output, which is a basically a useless integer, is used instead to
keep the output consistent.

Output data as tab separated values. The values are ordered as follows: title,
app-id, maximized, minimized, activated, fullscreen, outputs. Title and app-id
are quoted. States are boolean ("true" or "false"). The outputs field is a comma
separated list of the quoted names of outputs the toplevel is on or "none" if
the toplevel is not on any output.
